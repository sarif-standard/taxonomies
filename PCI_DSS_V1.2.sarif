The cardholder data environment is an example of a more sensitive area within the trusted network of a company.\nA firewall examines all network traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the specified security criteria.\nAll systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted networks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employees’ Internet access through desktop browsers, employees’ e-mail access, dedicated connection such as business to business connections, via wireless networks, or via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key systems. Firewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network."
